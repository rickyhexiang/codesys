         README: Xilinx Zynq-7000 board with CortexA9 MPCore

This file contains board-specific information for the Xilinx Zynq-7000
board with CortexA9 MPCore core tile. This file documents BSP interface 
changes from previous software or hardware versions, and notifies the
user of serious caveats that must be noted before using this BSP. 
Additionally, the target board's reference entry (i.e. xlnx_zynq7k/target.ref) 
provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks and should 
be read fully before this BSP is used.
